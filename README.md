# FracturalVisualNovelEngine

![Deploy](https://github.com/Fractural/FracturalCommons/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg) ![Unit Tests](https://github.com/Fractural/FracturalCommons/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

A flexible text-based visual novel engine for Godot written in GDScript. Partly inspired by [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/).

The goal of this engine is to be an extensible visual novel system capable of integrating itself into any project. With extensibility in mind, many features of the engine can be added onto with ease.

# Features

- StoryScript, a custom language made to write visual novels in. It has syntax that is similar to Ren'Py's language.
- Saving and loading
- Skipping and auto stepping
- Pausing
- Actors, which are movable, animatable, and transitionable onscreen objects.
  - Visuals
  - Background scenes
  - Text printers
- Transitions
- Animations
- Movement
